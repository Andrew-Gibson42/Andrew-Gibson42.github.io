    <p>Even though I don't consider myself a big nature guy, the one thing that these places have in common is
    that they're all focused on a natural formation of some sort. Although I probably wouldn't make a full trip out if it,
    visiting the grand canyon would undoubtedly be a breathtaking experience. Everybody who's been there claims that
    pictures don't do it justice. Similarly, wonder can be found in the size and power of nature with Diamond Head Mountain
    and the Redwood forests. Although it doesn't specifically have to be Alaska, I'd also like to visit some place
    with vibrant northern lights-- Alaska just seems especially beautiful outside of that as well. One other option
    would be Sweden, with the addition of a functional hotel made entirely out of ice-- a unique experience found no where
    else in the world, to my knowledge. I can't imagine that I'd get a good night's sleep there, but it'd be a
    fun experience either way. Getting away from society to go out and see the entire milky way has always been a goal
    of mine, and the salt flats offer a more unique experience. Acting as a natural mirror, the sky is reflected, offering
    a more vibrant view.</p>
